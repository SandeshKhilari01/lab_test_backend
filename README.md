## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: Detects test intent from conversational input and handles synonyms
- **Multi-modal Support**: Voice, chat, and phone call interfaces
- **Smart Validation**: Address, pincode, and landmark verification
- **Intelligent Scheduling**: Lab availability and technician slot management
- **Multi-test Booking**: Book multiple tests with unified instructions
- **Secure Authentication**: OTP-based verification via SMS
- **Automated Notifications**: SMS and email confirmations via Twilio
- **Bilingual Support**: English and Hindi language options
